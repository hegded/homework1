What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Git merge keeps the histories of both branches even after the merge is completed since it takes the contents of the feature branch and integrates it into the master branch. Git rebase provides a cleaner merge history by reapplying commits on top of another branch but this means it rewrites the branch's history. Visually, merge has two lines (branches) that merge into one line whereas rebase is just linear.
